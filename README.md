# discord_bot
This is a poorly written Discord bot for a streaming community server!

To use this bot:
	1. Install the dependencies found in requirements.txt
	2. Place your bot token in example.env, and rename it to '.env'
	3. Adjust the values in main.py to match your stream time
	4. Adjust role names to match the roles of your server
